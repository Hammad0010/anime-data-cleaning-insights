Project Overview
This project focuses on the cleaning, transformation, and analysis of a comprehensive anime dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover insightful trends and patterns that can inform anime recommendations, ratings analysis, and viewer preferences studies. This repository contains all the scripts, documentation, and output files used in the analysis.
